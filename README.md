## Installation

### From Github
Clone this repository and then install `epiccli` by navigating to the root directory and running `pip install --editable .`

## About
The CLI is built using [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/6/) to handle boilerplate and is packaged over pypi. 

The `pyepic` module manages interactions with the EPIC REST API. It uses the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) modules to make expose methods to the user abstracting the more complicated HTTP requests that occur under the hood.
